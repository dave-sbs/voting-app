QUESTIONS
[] People with the same name?
    [] It currently resets the tally, even if both appear on the voter page and on the current candidates list
    [] On the voter page, they share the same name so they will both activate and deactivate
[] What happens with Unique Vote Count when all people have been removed?
    [] I think it doesn't store state in a conventional way either. I think it resets on some instances - test more tomorrow!
[] Do we want Sign up
    [] There is no way to protect it
    [] What if someone forgets the username or password?
