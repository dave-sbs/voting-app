Project Notes
DONE
[D] App is borderline functional
[D] Voter page UI is more or less there. Need to implement the picture part
[D] Admin page has most functionalities set up
[D] Add Minimum Choice input in admin, add image upload in admin
[D] Users are not removed from the Tally table after being deleted which makes me think the Tally vote doesn't re-render properly
[D] Not sure if its tallyVotes() or TallyTable but the tallies aren't properly displayed
[D] Implement proper UI for admin page
[D] Fix voter page card layout
[D] Profile display section in Add Candidates behaves weirdly on phone.


TO DO
[] Implement SignIn and SignUp pages


QUESTIONS
[] People with the same name?
    [] It currently resets the tally, even if both appear on the voter page and on the current candidates list
    [] On the voter page, they share the same name so they will both activate and deactivate
[] What happens with Unique Vote Count when all people have been removed?
    [] I think it doesn't store state in a conventional way either. I think it resets on some instances - test more tomorrow!
